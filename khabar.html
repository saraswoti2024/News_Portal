        Taking part in the debate on the government's policies and programmes in the House of Representatives today, Oli said that the government was acting like Nero who played the flute while Rome was burning. He said the government's document was full of contradictions. In point 5 of the government's document, the government says that things have improved significantly and the economy is doing alright, but in point 14, the government says that economy is in crisis, Oli added.Stating that there was no plan to achieve high rate of economic growth, Oli said there was no vision for achieving the goals of social justice. Policy and programme document lacks vision, objective and goal, he added.The former PM said that economic indicators pointed that the country's economy was facing recession, but the government has not even realised this fact and it has not told the public about it. He said that the prime minister sought help of the international community to collect revenue. "How can the government do that? Is it not the government's primary priority to collect revenue? The government has failed in its primary first duty" he said.He said the government had achieved more than 6 per cent economic growth in 2017, 2018 and 2019, but that growth rate came down to an abysmal two per cent due to the mistakes of Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre coalition.
